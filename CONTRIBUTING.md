# How to contribute
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!

If you wish to submit a PR, **please make sure there's an Issue for it** first, and that said Issue isn't already assigned to someone else. **Ask for the Issue** in the comments so we can assign it to you!

## Are you a developer?

1. Check the Issues section.
2. Find issues with the label "dev".
3. Pick any Issue you'd like to solve (check that the Issue isn't already assigned to someone else).
4. Ask for the Issue in the comments and wait until it's assigned to you.
5. Fork the repo.
6. Solve the Issue in your fork.
7. Create a PR for this repo.

We'll appreciate it if PRs include only code related to the assigned Issue. Please keep contributions as atomic as possible, so they are easier to test and merge. We want to integrate your contributions as fast as possible!

1. Check the issues section.
2. Find Issues with the label "art".
3. Pick any Issue you'd like to solve (check that the Issue isn't already assigned to someone else).
4. Ask for the Issue in the comments and wait until it's assigned to you.

## Have an idea that's not covered in any issue?

Create a new Issue! The Issue will be automatically labeled as "idea". This allows us to review new issues and decide how to proceed.

Tip: Make sure your idea matches the general theme of the game.
