CollaboRun is an Infinite Runner game built through the collaboration of many amazing developers around the world!

We intend this project to be a learning experience for all of us, especially beginner game devs. The idea is for you to contribute with small features and take advantage of the available assets and code.

# Theme

TODO: Describe the basics of the game, character and maybe provide a color palette?
